# RocketTestStand

The .ino file is the arduino code that gets flashed to the arduino uno
The .py file is the file you can run to interpret the results of the LOG file.

First edit the path of the LOG file in the python code (current path is MY desktop) then
just run python3 rocket_test_stand.py
and enter the propellant weight when prompted and it should output a nice graph with data
